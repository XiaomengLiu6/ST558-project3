# render the "project3.RMD" file as a .md file called README.md.

#a brief description of the purpose of the repo
#• a list of R packages used
#• the code used to create the analyses from a single .Rmd file (i.e. the render() code)
#• links to .html files of the generated analyses (which will be created by github pages! Not you!) For
#example,
#– Analysis for [College Graduates](college_graduate_analysis.html). Note you should only
#have a college_graduate_analysis.md file in the repo - github pages will render the .html file
#for you
